# handwritten_digit_recognition
The older implementation written using Matlab has been pulled down by me. The current implementation uses Tensorflow and the Keras API. It boasts a better test set accuracy than the previous model. This implementation will soon be updated with one which uses convolution, which I am working on to get a better test accuracy than the current version.
